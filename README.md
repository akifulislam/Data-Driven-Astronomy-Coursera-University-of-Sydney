This repository contains the lessons I learned from this course and the assignment solutions I wrote.

Below is a breakdown of the learning modules covered.

## **Module 1: Thinking About Data**
⏱ **Duration:** 4 hours

This module introduces the foundational idea of **computational thinking** and explores the challenges posed by **big data**. We use the example of calculating the **median and mean stack of a set of radio astronomy images** to highlight the complexities involved when dealing with **large datasets**. 

Topics Covered:
- The importance of computational thinking
- Handling large datasets efficiently
- Calculating median and mean stacks for radio astronomy images

---

## **Module 2: Big Data Makes Things Slow**
⏱ **Duration:** 3 hours

In this module, we explore how the scalability of algorithms impacts performance as dataset sizes increase. Using the example of **cross-matching astronomical catalogs**, we investigate:
- Why some algorithms scale poorly with data
- Strategies for optimizing code for large datasets
- Real-world improvements for handling astronomical data efficiently

---

## **Module 3: Querying Your Data**
⏱ **Duration:** 3 hours

Large astronomy projects often rely on **databases** for data management. This module introduces **SQL**, the most commonly used database query language, and demonstrates how to:
- Query the **NASA Exoplanet database**
- Analyze and filter data to investigate **habitability of planets** in other solar systems

Key Skills:
- Writing SQL queries
- Managing and interpreting large datasets in databases

---

## **Module 4: Setting Up Databases**
⏱ **Duration:** 3 hours

This module covers the fundamental principles of **database setup and integration**. We delve into:
- Creating and organizing new database tables
- Combining **Python and SQL** to leverage the strengths of both for data analysis
- Exploring the **life cycles of stars in a stellar cluster**

---

## **Module 5: Learning from Data: Regression**
⏱ **Duration:** 3 hours

The concept of **machine learning** is introduced in this module. It focuses on:
- Standard methodologies for conducting machine learning experiments
- Applying regression techniques to astronomical data
- Using **decision trees for regression** to calculate **redshifts of distant galaxies**

---

## **Module 6: Learning from Data: Classification**
⏱ **Duration:** 2 hours

The final module explores **classification algorithms** and their limitations. We then investigate advanced methods, including:
- **Ensemble classifiers**
- The **random forest algorithm** for classifying galaxy images into different types

Key Takeaways:
- Understanding the limitations of decision tree classifiers
- Applying ensemble methods for improved classification accuracy
